# Justin Lee Portfolio

## Overview
This is my personal site that I use as a portfolio and as a playground for development.  It is built with Angular with an SPA design.  Currently, I intend to use this as a portfolio for my personal projects, photography, and blog.  The blog is powered by the Blogger REST API and Google Cloud.
