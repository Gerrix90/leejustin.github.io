                    <p>I'm a San Francisco Bay Area native who works as a software developer. I intend for this website to serve as both a portfolio of my personal work and also as my playground for development. For my current professional details, please visit my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinylee/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
                    <p>I have an adopted, senior chihuahua named Lucky who was found on the freeway. I am most productive when
                        I am pair programming with my chihuahua. Over time, I have grown very experienced in giving him head
                        scratches.</p>
                    <p>In my free time, I enjoy researching about finance, hiking, taking photos, or dancing. I am an avid hip
                        hop, salsa, and an aspiring Lindy Hop swing dancer.</p>
                    <p>More details to come...</p>
